This is a good first step for locating hotspots in one's program and is frequently all one needs to do to optimize the program. However, sometimes the cause of the hotspot is actually a single line in the function, and that line may not be obvious from just reading the source code. These cases are particularly frequent in scientific computing. Functions tend to be larger (sometimes because of legitimate algorithmic complexity, sometimes because the programmer is still trying to write FORTRAN code), and a single statement without function calls can trigger lots of computation when using libraries like numpy. cProfile only times explicit function calls, not special methods called because of syntax. Consequently, a relatively slow numpy operation on large arrays like this,\n",

In a typical workflow, one only cares about line timings of a few functions because wading through the results of timing every single line of code would be overwhelming. However, LineProfiler does need to be explicitly told what functions to profile."
