    "# What is Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to start with defining what probability is. There are three main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Classical probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "$Pr(X=x) = \\\\frac{\\\\text{# x outcomes}}{\\\\text{# possible outcomes}}\\$\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical probability is an assessment of **possible** outcomes of elementary events. Elementary events are assumed to be equally likely\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Frequentist probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "$Pr(X=x) = \\\\lim_{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\text{# times x has occurred}}{\\\\text{# independent and identical trials}}\\$\n",
    "\n",
    "This interpretation considers probability to be the relative frequency \\\"in the long run\\\" of outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Subjective probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Subjective probability is a measure of one's uncertainty in the value of \\\\\\(X\\\\\\\\). It characterizes the state of knowledge regarding some unknown quantity using probability.In simple terms,An event's probability is the degree of belief that the event will occur. Subjective probabilities are personal judgments based on all of the assessor's previous experience relevant to the situation at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not associated with long-term frequencies nor with equal-probability events.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  X = the true prevalence of diabetes in Bengaluru is < 15,\n",
    "-  X = the blood type of the person sitting next to you is type A\n",
    "-  X = it is raining in Bengaluru,India\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover on this more in our future blogs where we delve into Frequentist vs Bayesian Approach to Statistics but for now we will consider Frequentist approach and will talk about Probabilites as frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Defintion which I like:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability** is the measure of certainity of an event taking place.<br>\n",
    "The world we see around us is full of phenomena we perceive as random or unpredictable. We aim to model this phenomena as outcomes of some experiment. The outcomes are a result of sample space and subsets of sample space are called events. The events will be assigned a probability a number between 0 and 1 that expresses how likely the event is to occur."
